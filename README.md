## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

* An AWS Account with programmatic access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
* A running Jenkins server (e.g., accessible at `http://13.235.33.124:8080/`).
* Jenkins configured with AWS credentials (stored securely using Jenkins' Credentials Manager).
* Terraform (v1.12.2 or compatible) installed on the Jenkins agent.
* An EC2 Key Pair in your AWS account (e.g., named `primevideo`) for SSH access to deployed instances.

### Deployment Steps (via Jenkins)

1.  **Clone this Repository:** Ensure your Jenkins pipeline is configured to clone this GitHub repository (`https://github.com/mrinalini7788/amazon-prime-video-kubernetes.git`).
2.  **Configure Jenkins Credentials:**
    * In Jenkins, navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Credentials".
    * Add your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key as a "Secret text" or "AWS Credentials" type. Ensure the ID matches what's referenced in the `Jenkinsfile` (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
3.  **Jenkinsfile Configuration:** The `Jenkinsfile` is configured to:
    * Checkout the `main` branch of this repository.
    * Run `terraform init`, `validate`, `plan`, and `apply` (or `destroy` based on a parameter).
    * Pass Terraform variables such as `key_name` (`primevideo`) and `instance_name` (`Monitoring_server`) via Jenkins environment variables.
4.  **Trigger the Pipeline:** Run the Jenkins pipeline job (e.g., `monitoringserver`) configured for this repository. You can select `apply` or `destroy` as a build parameter.

### Terraform Variables

The `terraform/variables.tf` defines key inputs:

* `instance_name`: The name tag for the EC2 instance (e.g., "Monitoring\_server").
* `key_name`: The name of the AWS EC2 Key Pair to associate with the instance (e.g., "primevideo").
    *(Note: `access_key` and `secret_key` variables in `variables.tf` are generally superseded by environment variables set in Jenkins for provider authentication and can often be removed or marked `sensitive` if explicitly needed for other modules.)*

GitHub: Leveraged as a distributed version control system for managing application source code and facilitating collaborative development.

üöÄ Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins
Jenkins as a CI/CD Tool: Successfully set up and configured Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

Pipeline Creation: Developed and managed diverse Jenkins pipelines, including:

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Deployment (CD)

Infrastructure setup (monitoring server)

Declarative Pipelines: Gained practical experience in writing robust declarative Jenkins pipelines using Groovy.

Jenkins Architecture: Understood Jenkins Master-Agent (formerly Master-Slave) concepts for workload distribution and scalability.

Plugin Management: Installed and utilized essential Jenkins plugins (e.g., SonarQube Scanner, NodeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, Pipeline Stage View, Blue Ocean, Prometheus, Eclipse Temurin Installer, Extended Email Notification) to extend functionality.

Credential Management: Configured and managed sensitive credentials (e.g., SonarQube token, Docker Hub, AWS access keys, Gmail app password) securely within Jenkins' credential vault.

Webhooks: Implemented webhooks for automatic Jenkins pipeline triggers upon code pushes to GitHub.

Build Parameterization: Enabled flexible pipeline execution through parameterized builds (e.g., apply or destroy for infrastructure).

Pipeline Troubleshooting: Developed strong skills in identifying and resolving errors in Jenkins pipeline executions.

üîç Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
SonarQube: Integrated SonarQube Community Edition into the CI pipeline to scan source code for vulnerabilities, hotspots, bugs, and code smells.

Configured SonarQube with Jenkins using authentication tokens and webhooks for automated quality gate checks.

Utilized SonarQube reports to identify and prioritize code quality issues.

üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Scanning
Aqua Trivy: Employed Aqua Trivy Community Version to scan application file systems for sensitive information (like API keys, access keys) and identify outdated packages or vulnerabilities.

Used Trivy for scanning Docker images to detect vulnerabilities.

üê≥ Containerization with Docker
Dockerfile Creation: Wrote Dockerfiles to define application environments and build Docker images.

Image Management: Built, tagged, and pushed Docker images to Docker Hub for artifact storage.

Container Deployment: Deployed the application as Docker containers for local testing.

Proficient in essential Docker commands for managing images and containers (docker ps, docker images).

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS)
EC2 Instances: Created and managed EC2 virtual machines (Ubuntu LTS) for hosting Jenkins, SonarQube, and monitoring tools.

Security Groups: Configured AWS Security Groups to control network traffic by opening necessary ports (e.g., 8080 for Jenkins, 9000 for SonarQube, 3000 for Node.js/Grafana, 9090 for Prometheus, 9115 for Blackbox Exporter, SMTP ports).

IAM Roles/Users: Created IAM users with specific policies to grant programmatic access for AWS CLI and Jenkins to interact with AWS services.

‚ò∏Ô∏è Container Orchestration with Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
EKS Cluster Deployment: Deployed a managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS) on AWS for scalable and resilient application deployment.

Kubernetes Architecture: Gained insights into Kubernetes master (control plane) and worker node architecture, including components like API server, scheduler, etcd, and controller manager.

Pod Management: Deployed the application as pods within the Kubernetes cluster.

Load Balancers: Exposed the application to the internet using AWS Load Balancers for stable access despite dynamic pod IPs.

Auto-healing: Observed Kubernetes' auto-healing capabilities (e.g., automatic pod replacement upon deletion).

YAML Manifests: Defined application deployments and services using Kubernetes YAML manifest files.

kubectl & eksctl: Utilized kubectl for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster and eksctl for managing EKS clusters.

üìù Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform: Employed Terraform to define, provision, and manage AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances for monitoring servers) as code.

Understood core Terraform concepts: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, and terraform apply/destroy workflows.

üìà Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus Setup: Deployed and configured Prometheus as a monitoring server to collect metrics.

Grafana Dashboarding: Used Grafana to visualize Prometheus data by importing pre-built dashboards (e.g., for Jenkins, Blackbox Exporter) and creating custom visualizations.

Exporters: Utilized Blackbox Exporter to monitor the availability and performance of external HTTP endpoints (application URL, domain). Also understood the role of Node Exporter for server metrics.

Configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from various targets, including Blackbox Exporter, Jenkins, and the application's domain.

üåê Networking and DNS
Understood concepts of various ports (HTTP, HTTPS, Jenkins, SonarQube, Node.js, SMTP, Prometheus, Grafana, Blackbox Exporter).

Configured DNS records (CNAME) using Cloudflare to map a custom subdomain (app.cloudaasim.com) to the application's load balancer for user-friendly access.

Applied SSL/TLS certification to the custom domain for secure connections.

Gained insights into how IP addresses are assigned to different services and instances (e.g., Jenkins server accessible via a public IP like http://13.235.33.124:8080/, and dynamically assigned IPs for EC2 instances after Terraform provisioning).Monitoring server(ip=65.2.183.124)

‚úçÔ∏è Scripting and Automation
Gained experience in shell scripting for automating repetitive tasks like installing multiple applications and setting permissions on Linux.

Familiarity with basic Linux commands and best practices for server management (e.g., sudo apt update, git clone, chmod, netstat, nano editor).

üíª Application Development Stack
Worked with applications built using Next.js and Node.js, understanding their dependencies and execution environment (npm install, port 3000).

üí∞ Cost Management in Cloud
Learned the importance of destroying cloud resources after project completion to avoid unnecessary costs and the process of requesting bill waivers from AWS.
